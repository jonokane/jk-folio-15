                <dd>A large part of my career at Yahoo! has been spent prototyping and designing various aspects of Yahoo!'s Developer Network. In 2007, I pioneered a method of rapid iterative prototyping for usability testing which involved building prototypes with real markup, instead of Flash (which was the industry standard method for usability prototypes at the time). This proved to be successful, as many aspects of the prototype itself were used as production code.

In addition to building prototypes for Yahoo!/YDN, I also designed various features including the api uptime dashboard, app-publish functionality, YDN events and other modules.</dd>
